Bug Fixes and New Features for the FBC Food Bank Database, Version 1.0.1.0 vs. Version 1.0.0.0:


Bug Fixes
---------
* Fixed some bugs dealing with updating the database, "Concurrency Violations".
This was resolved by not allowing a contact name and the visits to be edited at the same time, without saving
changes to the database.

* Fixed a bug in selecting the date range for reports, in that the last day was not being included in the report.

* Fixed a bug that could occur when certain characters are entered into the Name Search box.

* Fixed a potential bug, in that if you try to import the existing database file from the location the program
is already using, the database would be destroyed.


New Features
------------
* Visits are now sorted in the grid by date in descending order, by default.

* Added a confirmation prompt if adding a duplicate visit when using the "Add Visit Now" feature.

* Added a confirmation prompt when a contact is deleted.

* Added a confirmation prompt when one or more visits are deleted.

* Added a 'Deceased' field for each contact.  When a contact is marked as deceased, they are automatically marked as 'Inactive'.

* Added Edit...Add Visit Now menu item with a keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+N

* Added a View...Inactive Contacts menu item.

* Added an icon for the Edit...Find menu item.

* Removed the tooltip from the Name Search box.

* Added a "Sort by Name" option when creating reports.

* Dates in the visits grid can now be edited using a calendar picker control.

* The visits grid now contains the number of adults and the number of children in the household for each date visited.
Therefore, the report will properly reflect the number of household members at the time of the visit.
If a visit in the existing database does not specify the number of adults or number of children in the household for that date,
it will be populated with the household members currently in the contact information.

* Added a right-click menu to the visits grid to delete the selected visits.

* Added a custom date range when creating a report where you can specify the start and end dates using a calendar picker control.
